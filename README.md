# Humble-Minecraft
Yk what they say: Little strokes fell great oaks!!



I recently dipped my toes into Java programming using a Minecraft project! It is a creative sandbox game for those new to the blocky world. 

Leveraging the Java Point website's tutorials, I built a basic Java application interacting with Minecraft data (think random item names or structure volume calculations). While this was a great starting point, it's just the first pickaxe swing in a long mining expedition. It may seem a simple and common project, but don't deceive your sights; as a pinky promise, I assure you that you won't be dawdling around in this project! I'm excited to refine and expand this repository, using it as a springboard for future Java adventures

I apologize for the current state of the repository; it might seem unorganized. This is ought to the fact that I'm new to actively using GitHub as a user!!
Don't worry though, the code will be constantly updated and improved. I will also include comments to explain the changes made
