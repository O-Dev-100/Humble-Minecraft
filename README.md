# Humble-Minecraft
Yk what they say: Little strokes fell great oaks!!



I recently dipped my toes into Java programming using a Minecraft project! It is a creative sandbox game for those new to the blocky world. 

Leveraging the Java Point website's tutorials, I built a basic Java application interacting with Minecraft data (think random item names or structure volume calculations). While this was a great starting point, it's just the first pickaxe swing in a long mining expedition. It may seem a simple and common project, but don't deceive your sights; as a pinky promise, I assure you that you won't be dawdling around in this project! I'm excited to refine and expand this project, using it as a springboard for future Java adventures
